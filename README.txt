Audio and video modules for Max/MSP Jitter

These modules have been developed for the Jamoma platform. 
This repository is now the official repository for my Jamoma modules.
Parts of the code are found at cycling 74 website, tutorials and examples.
Some of the modules are changed from the Jamoma modules developed by the Jamoma team. www.jamoma.org

To install Jamoma for Max please visit: www.jamoma.org


Some of the modules requires third party objects which I cannot incorporate in this repository. You need to acquire them from Electrotap.
